# Earlier versions of qasync had horrendous threading issues on Windows, which (for not
# entirely obvious reasons) mostly show up on Python 3.10 and up. Thus far, ndscan still
# works against both Qt 5 and Qt 6, but since early ARTIQ 9, upstream ARTIQ has switched
# to Qt 6. If working against older versions of ARTIQ is of interest, we can revisit the
# way the dependencies are specified here.
