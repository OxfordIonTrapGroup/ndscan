ndscan – N-dimensional scans for ARTIQ
======================================

`ndscan` extends the [ARTIQ](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq) real-time
laboratory control system with the concept of _fragments_ – building blocks that
accept parameters and produce result data – and tools for productively working
with experiments consisting of many such parts. In particular, `ndscan` allows
users to easily override parameters from anywhere in the system on the fly, and
to acquire data by iterating over (“scanning”) any number of them at a time.

See the [documentation](https://oxfordiontrapgroup.github.io/ndscan) for more
information. 

**`ndscan` is beta-grade software. While the system has been carefully
architected and the library is in active use within the
[Ion Trap Quantum Computing Group](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/ion-trap-quantum-computing-group),
large parts of the implementation are still best considered a minimum viable
product.** If you cannot work out how a particular use case would be addressed
using the library, please do get in touch: Many common lab scenarios will already
be accommodated by the current design, but perhaps the necessary interfaces were
not publicly exposed to keep the library easy to learn and flexible in terms
of implementation during initial development. Other tasks might require
extensions to the library, but detailed design ideas for them might already
exist.


Quickstart guide
----------------

To get started with `ndscan`, first prepare a Python 3.5+ environment with
ARTIQ as usual (Nix, Conda or some form of virtualenv is recommended). While
the intention is for ndscan to be a pure add-on to ARTIQ, some **required**
**patches** have not made their way into the official (M-Labs) upstream
repository yet. For now, use the
[ion-trap/master](http://gitlab.physics.ox.ac.uk/ion-trap/artiq/) 
branch; if you are an external user, you can find a summary patch in
[Issue 1](https://github.com/OxfordIonTrapGroup/ndscan/issues/1#issuecomment-667569040).

Once your environment is set up, install this package. For example, to use
ndscan directly from the Git checkout:

    (artiq) $ python setup.py develop

If you haven't already, also install the
[oitg](http://github.com/OxfordIonTrapGroup/oitg) package.

You are then ready to run the sample experiments. Start the ARITQ master
process as usual

    (artiq) $ artiq_master

and launch the dashboard with the ndscan plugin loaded

    (artiq) $ artiq_dashboard -p ndscan.dashboard_plugin

Now, navigate to the `examples/rabi_flop.py` file in the experiment explorer,
and you should be able to play around with the scan interface. (Applets are
created automatically; you might want to set the CCB mode to "Create and
enable/disable applets" in the applets dock.)


Developer notes
---------------

 - Format _all_ code using [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf), and make
   sure `flake8 ndscan` passes. Configuration files for both are included, and
   are picked up automatically. It is just not worth spending time to obsess
   or argue about formatting details.

 - Unit tests are run using `python -m unittest -v discover test`.

 - `conda` contains a very rudimentary [Conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/)
   package definition for integration with the continuous integration pipeline
   internal to the Ion Trap Quantum Computing group. The package is not 
   currently published on a public Conda channel, and likely won't ever be.
