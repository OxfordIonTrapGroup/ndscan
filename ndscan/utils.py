    """Shorten a list of names (typically fully qualified names or paths, "FQNs") by
    removing common prefixes where possible to leave only the suffixes necessary to
    keep the names unambiguous.

    The strings are not truncated at arbitrary locations, but only at separators
    dividing the full names into parts (e.g. ``/``, ``.``). In this implementation, this
    is achieved via the ``get_last_n_parts()`` parameter, which is flexible but a bit
    inefficient; if the strings are long, the implementation should be specialised for
    e.g. the common case of parts being delimited by a single separator character.

    :param fqns: The collection of names to shorten (typically ``str``s, but could be
        an arbitrary type that is ordered and supports a notion of reversal via
        ``[::-1]``). The elements must be unique, but are not assumed to be sorted in
        any particular order.
    :param get_last_n_parts: A callable (function/lambda/…) such that
        ``get_last_n_parts(fqn, n)`` returns the ``n`` last parts of FQN. What
        constitutes a part can be adapted to the application, but it must be consistent
        with the obvious notion of "last" such that strings with the same
        ``get_last_n_parts`` result actually share a common string suffix (of
        whatever arbitrary length). The case where ``n`` exceeds the number of available
        parts should be handled by (simply returning the full
        element in that case). Example: ``lambda fqn, n: "/".join(fqn.split("/")[-n:])``
        is a simple implementation to split strings at forward slashes.
